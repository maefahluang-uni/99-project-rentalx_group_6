- ## Background and Problem Definition

The higher education landscape has been witnessing significant growth, resulting in an influx of students seeking accommodation near their campuses. However, many students, especially international students, struggle to find suitable off-campus housing due to factors like unfamiliarity with the area, budget constraints, and a lack of reliable information sources.

Therefore, our business platform is an innovative online platform designed to address the housing challenges faced by MFU university students. This web-based platform aims to simplify the process of finding affordable, convenient, and safe housing options for students attending colleges and universities. With a growing demand for off-campus housing, this service seeks to connect students with suitable rental properties near the university, leveraging the power of the web to make the search for housing more accessible and efficient.

   - Empower students to discover their ideal housing based on location, budget, and housing type.

### 3. Empower landlords and property managers

   - Efficient accommodation search process.

2. **Provide instant dormitory availability information**
   - Informed decision-making for students.
